# Los Angeles Crime Data

## Overview
---
Analyzing Los Angeles Crime data using JavaScript and Leaflet and presneting all of this data via a map, plot, and tables to display this information. 

## Analysis
---
I created a table visualization of the data for each county spanning 10 years. There is a dropdown button that allows you to select a given county to view their data. I also created a seperate table to analyze the crime data in one year between the counties.

Now when entering the year this also affects the map. When you enter a year selected you are then able to choose a selected crime above the leaflet map. When choosing the crime a popup will appear on the county selected giving you the crime data for the year selected. In this map it also outlines borders of each county.

Then this is a final visualization at the bottom of the page displaying a graph of the crime data throughout the 10 year span based on the county you choose in the first table.
